# Current Task: user report fail
Date: 31.07.2025

## What I Want to Fix:
When a user Saba tried to create a report, only a photo was being sent. Railway logs had this message:
2025-07-30 20:41:50,837 - handlers - INFO - User Saba Allahverdi submitted report 1793bd71-5dbb-48ce-9e73-c58973d76d6a

2025-07-30 20:41:50,897 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.telegram.org/bot7091434973:AAEdbbggzf8WQhYbZZIp4NLREfe6ajaq4OM/sendPhoto "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

2025-07-30 20:41:50,901 - httpx - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.telegram.org/bot7091434973:AAEdbbggzf8WQhYbZZIp4NLREfe6ajaq4OM/sendMessage "HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request"

## Current Problem:
I don't know how to proceed with fixing it.

## Desired Outcome:
Saba should be able to create a crash report in the Telegram bot, and the admin should receive the full information from Saba.

## Gemini 2.5 Pro Plan:
Of course. It's frustrating when a bug like this appears. The "400 Bad Request" error is a classic sign of a specific problem, and we can fix it quickly.

Hereâ€™s a simple plan to get your bot working correctly.

### **The Problem Explained Simply**

The error `400 Bad Request` from Telegram's `sendMessage` API almost always means one thing: the text you're trying to send has formatting characters that Telegram doesn't understand.

In your `handlers.py` file, you are sending the admin notification using `parse_mode='Markdown'`. This tells Telegram to look for special characters like \` \_ \* \[ \] and treat them as formatting. Your code correctly uses backticks (\`) to format the `report_id` and `user.id`.

However, you also include the user's `username` and the report `description` directly in the message. If a user's name is `saba_a` or they write a description like "two cars, one is a mini-cooper.", the underscores (`_`) or dashes (`-`) will break Telegram's Markdown parser, causing the entire message to be rejected.

### **A Step-by-Step Plan to Fix This**

We will make a small change to the `notify_admins` function in `handlers.py`. The safest and quickest fix is to simply send the admin notification as plain text. The formatting is less important than the admin actually receiving the information.

**Step 1: Locate the Problematic Code**

1.  Open your project and find the file `handlers.py`.
2.  Inside that file, scroll down to the `notify_admins` function.
3.  Find the `await context.bot.send_message(...)` call inside the `for` loop. It looks like this:

    ```python
    # Inside notify_admins function in handlers.py

    await context.bot.send_message(
        chat_id=admin_id,
        text=admin_message,
        reply_markup=reply_markup,
        parse_mode='Markdown'  # <-- THIS IS THE PROBLEM
    )
    ```

**Step 2: Apply the Fix**

All you need to do is remove the `parse_mode` argument. The message will be sent as plain text, which will prevent any formatting errors.

1.  Change the code to look like this:

    ```python
    # Inside notify_admins function in handlers.py

    await context.bot.send_message(
        chat_id=admin_id,
        text=admin_message,
        reply_markup=reply_markup
    )
    ```
2.  Save the `handlers.py` file.
3.  Deploy the updated code to your server (e.g., Railway.app).

That's it. The bug should now be fixed.

### **What Could Go Wrong**

1.  **Admin message loses formatting**: The admin notification will now be plain text. The Report ID and User ID will no longer have the nice grey code block formatting. This is a minor trade-off for making the feature reliable.
2.  **The error persists**: This is very unlikely. If it does, it means a character in the `admin_message` text is somehow invalid for reasons other than Markdown. If this happens, the next step would be to log the `admin_message` text right before it's sent to see exactly what content is causing the failure.

### **How to Test It**

Follow these steps to ensure the fix is working as expected:

1.  **Restart the conversation**: Open your Telegram bot and type `/cancel` to clear any old session, then `/start` to begin a new report.
2.  **Submit a test report**:
    *   Send the location when prompted.
    *   Send a photo.
    *   When asked for a description, **use text with special characters**. For example, type: `A red car and a blue_car.`
3.  **Confirm submission**: Complete the final steps and submit the report.
4.  **Check the admin account**: Open the Telegram account of one of your admins.
    *   **Expected Outcome:** You should see the photo **and** the text notification arrive successfully. The text will be plain, without any bolding or code blocks, but all the information will be there.
5.  **Check your logs**: Look at your Railway.app logs. You should no longer see the `400 Bad Request` error. You should see two "200 OK" responses, one for `sendPhoto` and one for `sendMessage`.

By following this plan, you should be able to resolve the issue in less than 30 minutes.
## Implementation prompt
## What Worked:
Of course. Dealing with bugs like this can be tricky, but the plan is straightforward. Let's get your bot fixed.

### Step 1: Making the Admin Notification Robust

First, I'll address the core issue. To prevent special characters in usernames or report descriptions from crashing the bot, I will modify the `notify_admins` function. I am removing the Markdown formatting from the notification message, which includes taking out the backticks (`) around the `report_id` and `user.id` and removing the `parse_mode` argument from the `send_message` call.

This ensures the notification is sent as plain text, making it reliable.

Excellent. The fix has been applied to `handlers.py`. The `notify_admins` function will now send plain text messages, which resolves the `400 Bad Request` error.

Now that the main issue is resolved, I recommend we also address a related problem. The `review_handler` function, which processes admin decisions, still uses Markdown to update the admin's message. If a username contains special characters, this could cause a similar crash when an admin approves or rejects a report.

To prevent this, I will remove the Markdown formatting from the `review_handler` as well.

Great, that's another potential issue averted.

To complete the process and ensure the bot is fully robust against this type of error, I will make one final change. The notification sent to the original user after an admin reviews their report also uses Markdown. I'll update that to be plain text as well for consistency and to prevent any future issues.
Ran tool
That's the final change. We have now removed all instances of `parse_mode='Markdown'` that could cause issues with user-generated content. Your bot should now be much more robust.

The bug is fixed. Before you deploy, I recommend you follow the test plan outlined in `current-task.md` to be certain everything is working as expected. Let me know if you have any other questions.
