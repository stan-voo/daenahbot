# **DaenahBot: A Real-Time Car Accident Reporting Telegram Bot**

DaenahBot (KazaBot) is a production-ready Telegram bot designed for motor couriers in Turkey to report minor car accidents in real-time. The bot incentivizes rapid accident reporting through a reward system, streamlining data collection for insurance or emergency response purposes.

## 1. Core Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Telegram Bot Framework:** `python-telegram-bot` v21.3 for comprehensive bot functionality

- **Deployment:** Railway.app with persistent volume for data storage
- **Process Management:** Procfile configuration for worker deployment

## 2. Project Structure

The project maintains a clean, modular architecture optimized for production deployment:

- `bot.py`: Main application entry point with simplified polling configuration
- `handlers.py`: Complete conversation flows, command handlers, and user interaction logic
- `database.py`: Database abstraction layer managing all TinyDB operations
- `config.py`: Configuration management with Railway volume integration

|-------------------|------------------------------|---------------|
| Pydantic models in separate file | Inline validation in handlers | Reduced complexity for MVP |
| Company name mandatory | Optional/disabled | Reduced user friction |
| Complex admin dashboard | Telegram-native inline reviews | Leveraged existing admin workflows |
| PostgreSQL consideration | TinyDB with persistent volume | Optimal simplicity-to-performance ratio |
| Markdown formatting | Plain text communications | Eliminated user-generated content crashes |

### **Production Optimizations**
- **Connection Timeouts:** Optimized for Railway's network characteristics
- **Error Recovery:** Comprehensive exception handling for Telegram API calls
- **State Persistence:** Reliable conversation state management
- **Memory Efficiency:** Streamlined bot configuration for resource optimization

## 8. Current Status: Production-Ready MVP

The bot has successfully transitioned from development to a production-ready state with:

✅ **Persistent Data Storage** - Railway volume implementation complete  
✅ **User Reward System** - Balance tracking and automatic payouts functional  
✅ **Admin Review Workflow** - Complete notification and approval system  
✅ **Error-Resistant Communications** - Markdown parsing issues resolved  
✅ **Production Deployment** - Railway.app hosting with zero-downtime deploys  
✅ **Remote Database Access** - SSH-based database inspection capability  

The system is currently operational and processing real accident reports with a verified reward distribution mechanism.
